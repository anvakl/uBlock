# Submitting issues

Despite all the guidelines and warnings I added over the years about how to use it, the GitHub issue tracker always end up being used as a [help desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_desk) rather than a place to report actual, real and proven issues.

Typically help desk are best handled by enthusiast volunteers -- so hopefully this is what will happen.

Given this, from now on I will consider GitHub issue tracker as a help desk one for uBlock Origin. I unsubscribed from being notified from all issues being opened, I will visit once in a while as time and mood allow.

When I will be visiting the "help desk", I will focus **only** on issues which I have good reasons to believe to be valid issues with uBlock Origin **itself**.

Valid issues typically comes with minimal but detailed steps to reproduce (i.e. no guesswork whatsoever required for others to reproduce), and especially genuine efforts to investigate the cause of an issue **as far as possible** using all the browser tools (uBO is HTML/CSS/JS, the browser has all the tools to investigate all of this). These will have my attention, and I will address them.

In case I am really needed for a given issue, you can mention me using `@gorhill` so that GitHub will notify me.
